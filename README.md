# FMI Guides

[![Build Specification](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-guides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-guides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml)

This repository contains a number of  current prototype draft guides
for the current [Functional Mock-up Interface][FMI] 2.0 and upcoming
3.0 standard for the exchange of simulation models. Note that these
drafts are being worked on actively, and thus are subject to change
without notice.

They are not normative, nor are they to be considered officially
endorsed by the Modelica Association or other involved organisations
prior to official adoption.

The [FMI 3.0 Implementer's Guide][guide] is currently maintained on
[GitHub][githubguide] and is published [here][guide]. It is based on
the [FMI][] standard.

The [FMI 2.0/3.0 Profiles][profile] are currently maintained on
[GitHub][githubprofile] and is published [here][profile].

In future additional guides might be integrated into this repository.
