# FMI Guides

[![Build Specification](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-guides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-guides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml)

This repository contains the current prototype draft Implementers'
Guide for the upcoming [Functional Mock-up Interface][FMI] 3.0
standard for the exchange of simulation models.  Note that this draft
is being worked on actively, and thus subject to change without notice.
It is not normative, nor is it to be considered officially endorsed
by the Modelica Association prior to official adoption.

The [guide][] is currently maintained on [GitHub][github] and is
published [here][guide]. It is based on the [FMI][] standard.

In future additional guides might be integrated into this repository.
